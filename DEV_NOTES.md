# Map Scene v0.1 Notes

1. JSON source for regions is `Assets/StreamingAssets/game_data.json` (use icon keys like `region_northmarch`).
2. In Unity Editor run `Tools/FantasyGuildmaster/Generate Placeholder Icons` (optional, setup tool also auto-generates missing placeholders).
3. Run `Tools/FantasyGuildmaster/Setup Map Scene`, press Play, assign squad to a contract, wait for arrival, resolve Encounter card, then Continue back to map.
