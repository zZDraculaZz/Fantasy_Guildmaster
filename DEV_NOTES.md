# Map Scene v0.1 Notes

1. JSON source for regions is `Assets/StreamingAssets/game_data.json`.
2. In Unity Editor run `Tools/FantasyGuildmaster/Setup Map Scene` to auto-create/update scene UI and map prefabs.
3. Validation: press Play, click any region marker on the map, and verify the right panel updates with region details + contract timers ticking every second.
